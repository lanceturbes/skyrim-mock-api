# Skyrim Mock API

This is a simple web app, built with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) that allows fetching data from a mock Skyrim API using [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/).

## Installation

Enter the root directory of the project, and proceed to run the following commands to set up the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install # install packages listed in "package.json"
npm run setup-msw # install MSW to the project "dist" folder
```

## Usage

The app uses Parcel to serve the frontend. Simply run `npm start` from the root of the project to start a development server on `localhost:1234`, and visit that URL to view the application.
